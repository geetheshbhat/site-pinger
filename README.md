Know when your site goes down. A cronjob that keeps pining the sites every 1 minute.This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.4.

## Backend

I have used NodeJs and ExpressJs to setup the backend. For Database I have used Postgres with Sequelize which is ORM package, feel free to use NoSQL :-)

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
